Timeline Application for Elderly users and their Social Connections

This project aims to build a social application for elderly that will help them collect, enrich (also automatically) and share their life experiences, find potentially old friends and other people with similar experiences, and, ultimately, increase their social interactions and foster exploration of their lives. The metaphor we have chosen to implement the application is that of a timeline, where experiences are arranged along two dimensions: time and place. Building such application is challenging from an HCI/sociological point of view, because we need to thoroughly understand what elderly want share and how to lower the barriers for doing so via a dedicated application. And it is also challenging from a social network analysis point of view, because we need to understand how to collect relevant information from the Web to automatically enrich timelines with a context (timeline-based querying and ranking of information) and how to discover communities of people around shared or near experiences (timeline similarity algorithms). We evaluate the usability of the application (e.g., ease of use and acceptance) by doing users studies, and the viability of the underlying algorithms by mapping our problem to data that we can source from twitter, facebook, or other social networks with built-in timelines.
